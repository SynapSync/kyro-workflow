# Plan Sprint Mode

Generate a lean sprint-plan input and let `{{KYRO_CLI}} plan` materialize the next `activeSprint`. The agent never writes `sprint.json`.

## Inputs

1. Read `.agents/kyro/scopes/{scope}/sprint.json` (single source of truth).
2. From it, use `roadmap` (next sprint focus), `ledger[]` (previous outcomes + recommendations), `previousSprint`, `debt[]` (carry-forward), and `conventions[]` (apply learned rules to estimates and task context).
3. Read `../helpers/sprint-generator.md` only after the next sprint number is known.

## Workflow

If the user asked to complete/close the scope (work is done, no more sprints) rather than plan the next one: do not generate Sprint N+1. Preview `{{KYRO_CLI}} scope complete --kyro-scope {scope}` (no `--yes`), confirm, then `--yes`. Never treat that as retirement.

1. Resolve the next sprint number `N` from `roadmap.sprints` and `ledger[]` (highest closed + 1). Verify Sprint N-1 is closed when N > 1.
2. Extract roadmap focus, type, target version, and suggested phases for Sprint N.
3. For Sprint 2+, account for every previous recommendation from the last `ledger[]` entry: incorporate, defer, resolve, mark N/A, or convert to a phase. Nothing is silently dropped.
4. Assemble `phases[]` from roadmap suggestions, carried recommendations, and due `debt[]` items. Each task needs `id`, `title`, `description`, `files_to_touch`, `context`, `acceptance_criteria`, `depends_on`, optional `scenario_refs`, `status: "pending"`, `evidence: null`, `verdict: null`.
5. Fold relevant `conventions[]` into each task's `context`.
6. If `spec.requirements[]` exists, create or refine `spec.scenarios[]` as Given/When/Then checks per requirement, then set each task's `scenario_refs[]` to the scenarios it implements. Leave `scenario_refs: []` only when the task is intentionally non-spec work and explain that in `context`.

## Apply through the CLI

Run `{{KYRO_CLI}} plan --from <file> --kyro-scope {scope}`. `sprint-forge` is a skill, not a Task subagent. The lean input must describe:

- Set `activeSprint` to the new sprint object: `{ n, slug, title, objective, status: "executing", phases, emergentTasks: [], definitionOfDone }`. Copy `title` verbatim from `roadmap.sprints[]` for Sprint N — it must never be omitted (a missing title renders `Sprint N: undefined` in the archive narrative).
- Mark due `debt[]` items `in_progress` (do not delete or reset any debt).
- Update `roadmap.sprints[N-1].state` to `active`.
- Set `handoff.nextAction: "execute_task"`, `handoff.nextTaskId` to the first task id, `handoff.lastUpdated` to today.
- Preserve existing `spec.requirements`, `spec.nonGoals`, and `spec.openQuestions`; only add/refine `spec.scenarios` when planning reveals concrete behavior.

## Principles gate (before generating tasks)

- Read `project.json.principles[]`. No task may violate a `non-negotiable` principle. For free-text
  principles, confirm compliance explicitly; for principles with a `check`, `{{KYRO_CLI}} analyze` enforces
  them and will FAIL on violation. If a principle genuinely must bend, amend it explicitly — never
  ignore it silently.

## Clarity gate (before generating tasks)

- If any design-affecting detail is unknown, write `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <what is missing>]` in the
  relevant field instead of guessing, and set `handoff.nextAction: "clarify"` to resolve it first.
- Do NOT generate or finalize tasks while `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain — `{{KYRO_CLI}} doctor` and
  `{{KYRO_CLI}} analyze` fail on them. Resolve via `clarify.md`, then return here.

## Rules

- Never generate Sprint N+1 before Sprint N is closed (in `ledger[]`).
- Every previous recommendation must be incorporated, deferred, resolved, marked N/A, or converted to a phase.
- Debt is inherited completely; never reset or drop debt items.
- Write only the temporary lean plan input. No direct `sprint.json`, `phases/`, `*.summary.json`, `state.json`, or `index.json` writes.
