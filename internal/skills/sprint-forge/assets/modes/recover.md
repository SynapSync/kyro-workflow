# Recover Mode

Recover is only for scopes that exist (registered in `project.json` or present on disk). A scope that is neither is a creation flow: load `INIT.md` instead and never run `repair` for it.

Recover when `sprint.json` is missing/unparseable, or when `repair integrity prepare` reports findings.

## Inputs

1. Read `.agents/kyro/project.json` + `.agents/kyro/local.json`.
2. Run `{{KYRO_CLI}} repair integrity prepare --kyro-scope <scope> --json`, where `<scope>` is the
   scope the router already resolved before loading this mode. Never drop `--kyro-scope` here —
   doing so re-scans every scope and lets an unrelated scope's drift block this one.
3. If `sprint.json` is missing, also inspect close checkpoints for a resume path.

## Workflow

1. If prepare reports no findings and `sprint.json` is consistent, route normally. Do not ask the user anything.
2. If prepare reports `blockers` (unsupported, diverged, irreconcilable, identity-conflict, unrecoverable), show every blocker and stop. Do not apply. Restore or isolate the incompatible evidence first.
3. If prepare reports findings without blockers, show the human target list from the JSON (`targets`), including every convention, ADR, and ledger reanchor, not internal operation kinds. Ask exactly: “¿Autorizas la reparación?” Stop. Do not apply in the same unanswered turn.
4. After an explicit yes for that digest, run only:

   `{{KYRO_CLI}} repair integrity apply --kyro-scope <scope> --digest <digest> --yes`

   Then `{{KYRO_CLI}} doctor --artifacts --kyro-scope <scope>`. Never drop `--kyro-scope` here either
   — without it doctor falls back to auditing every scope, and unrelated drift can fail this check
   after the target scope was already repaired. If doctor exits 0, report PASS and continue routing. If apply returns `DIVERGED`, prepare again, show the new targets, and ask again. Retrying the same approved digest after a crash is required; do not treat a completed prefix as a new plan.
5. If `sprint.json` is missing and a close checkpoint can resume, retry `{{KYRO_CLI}} close-sprint` with that checkpoint's frozen inputs. Do not invent state.
6. Never hand-edit `sprint.json`, `project.json`, `local.json`, checkpoints, snapshots, or narratives.

## Rules

- One approval binds the exact listed targets and the prepare digest.
- Never add `--yes` without a fresh human answer to the current digest.
- Prefer preserving archive bytes over making state look clean.
- If multiple scopes are plausible for a missing-sprint resume, ask the user to choose before writing.
