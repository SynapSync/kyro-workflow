  <b>Shared sprint workflow for AI coding agents — install once, every agent uses the same source of truth.</b><br/>

## What You Get

Kyro is a **sprint harness** for AI coding agents. Install once, every agent uses the same source of truth:

- **Shared sprint cycle** — all agents follow init → plan → execute → review → close (gates enforced in code)
- **One scope file** — `.agents/kyro/scopes/{scope}/sprint.json` is the single source of truth
- **CLI-owned state** — schema and gates run every time; agents can't invent enums or hand-edit
- **Team-safe by default** — commit `project.json` + scopes; each dev has personal `local.json`
- **6 slash commands** — `/kyro:forge` (full cycle), `/kyro:status`, `/kyro:qa`, `/kyro:idea`, `/kyro:task-context`, `/kyro:scope-retire`

**Why it matters:** AI agents forget context, invent process, and edit planning files by hand. Across Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and others you re-explain the same workflow every session. Kyro stops this.

---

## Quick start

**Requirements:**
- Node.js ≥ 18
- Git
- Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or similar agent (must support plugins or skills)

### Install for any agent (Codex, OpenCode, CommandCode, etc.)

Use this path to install Kyro for agents other than Claude Code plugin:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
npx kyro-ai@latest install --init-workspace --yes
```

This installs:
- Global runtime at `~/.agents/kyro/current/`
- Command skills at `~/.agents/skills/kyro-*`
- Project state at `./.agents/kyro/`

Then invoke Kyro from your agent:
- **Codex, Grok, CommandCode**: via `kyro-*` skills (auto-discovered)
- **OpenCode**: via `/kyro/*` commands or `~/.config/opencode/skills/kyro-*`
- **Terminal**: `kyro forge`, `kyro status`, etc.

---

### Install Claude Code (Plugin)

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**

```
/plugin marketplace add SynapSync/kyro-ai
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**

```
/plugin install kyro-ai
```

**Step 3: Reload plugins**

```
/reload-plugins
```

**Step 4: Start your first sprint**

```
/kyro:forge implement OAuth2 authentication
```

You'll see the full cycle:

```text
INIT      objective + success criteria
─ gate ─  proceed / adjust / cancel?
PLAN      sprint tasks
─ gate ─  proceed / adjust / cancel?
EXECUTE   evidence via CLI (not hand JSON)
REVIEW    checker verdict via CLI
CLOSE     lossless checkpoint + ledger

state ›  .agents/kyro/scopes/oauth2-auth/sprint.json
```

That's it! The plugin works standalone. No extra setup needed.

---

### Teams: Initialize shared project state

If your team shares the repo and you want everyone on the same `project.json`, run once from the project root:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
npx kyro-ai@latest install --init-workspace --yes
```

This creates:
- `.agents/kyro/project.json` — shared, committed (team constitution + scopes registry)
- `.agents/kyro/local.json` — personal, gitignored (your active scope)

If scopes already exist from teammates, this registers them. Then set your active scope:

```bash
kyro scope set-active <scope> --yes
```

---

### Verify installation

```bash
npx kyro-ai@latest doctor
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
kyro doctor
```

---

### For local development

Clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynapSync/kyro-ai.git
cd kyro-ai && npm install && npm run build
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/kyro-ai
```

---

## Typical flows

**Use it when you want to...**

| Scenario | Command |
| -------- | ------- |
| Start a new feature sprint | `/kyro:forge implement email notifications` |
| Check progress on current work | `/kyro:status` |
| Get a summary before switching contexts | `/kyro:task-context` (copy-paste into a fresh session) |
| Audit code & architecture independently | `/kyro:qa` (runs outside the forge cycle) |
| Mature a rough idea into a plan | `/kyro:idea design a rate-limiting strategy` |
| Complete a finished scope | `/kyro:forge` (runs `kyro scope complete`; not retirement) |
| Retire an obsolete/superseded scope | `/kyro:scope-retire <scope>` (prepare, show plan, require fresh human approval) |
| Record evidence on a task | `kyro record-evidence <task> --evidence "…"` |
| Mark a task complete after review | `kyro review <task> --verdict pass` |
| Track technical debt | `kyro debt add --title "refactor auth" --tag database` |
| Wrap up a sprint | `kyro close-sprint --outcome success` |

---

## Day-to-day workflow

### Commands (routers)

Thin routers over scope state — they load only what the current step needs.

| Command / skill | Role |
| --------------- | ---- |
| `/kyro:forge` · `kyro-forge` | Full cycle: analyze → plan → execute → review → close a sprint or complete a finished scope |
| `/kyro:status` · `kyro-status` | Progress, roadmap, debt (`brief` / `full` / `debt`) |
| `/kyro:idea` · `kyro-idea` | Optional pre-scope: mature an idea into an execution-ready brief |
| `/kyro:qa` · `kyro-qa` | Independent certification audit (not the forge review gate) |
| `/kyro:task-context` · `kyro-task-context` | Copy-paste prompt to continue in a fresh context |
| `/kyro:scope-retire` · `kyro-scope-retire` | Two-phase retirement of an obsolete/superseded/discarded scope |

### Tool-owned CLI (required for state changes)

**Do not hand-edit** `.agents/kyro/scopes/*/sprint.json` or invent enums. Mutate state with the CLI so schema and gates run every time.

| Verb | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `… plan --from <file>` | Bootstrap scope or materialize the next sprint |
| `… clarify --from <file>` | Record accepted design clarifications without hand-editing scope state |
| `… record-evidence <task> …` | Maker evidence on a task |
| `… review <task> --verdict pass\|fail …` | Checker verdict |
| `… debt add\|start\|resolve\|…` | Formal debt lifecycle |
| `… rule add --rule "…" --tag process [--global]` | Register a scope rule; optionally promote it to every scope |
| `… close-sprint --outcome …` | Lossless close + checkpoint (never null `activeSprint` by hand) |
| `… scope complete --kyro-scope <scope> [--summary "…"] --yes` | Explicit finished-scope completion (Forge-owned; not retirement) |
| `… scope retire --kyro-scope <scope> --reason "…"` | Read-only retirement plan for an obsolete scope; apply only with its digest and explicit human `--yes` |
| `… context-pack --json` | Lean read for routing (prefer over opening full `sprint.json`) |
| `… doctor` / `… doctor --artifacts` | Health and artifact shape |
| `… analyze` | Semantic gates before close |

Replace `…` with your persisted invocation (`kyro`, or `node ~/.agents/kyro/current/dist/cli.js`). Full flags: [CLI](docs/cli.md).

### Repairing a legacy debt record in a closed scope

A closed scope's checkpoints, snapshots, narratives and ledger commitments are immutable and are
never rewritten. A wrong *live* record is corrected by an append-only, explicitly typed remediation
that leaves an immutable record of itself.

**Kyro 4.43.5 is origin-only.** Its single operation, `debt.origin.set`, repairs `origin` and
nothing else, so it cannot repair a record-level legacy shape: a debt that carries a string `origin`
*and* legacy-only keys like `detail`/`resolution`/`addedSprint` *and* missing canonical fields.
**4.44.0 and later** adds `debt.canonicalize` (remediation protocol v3), which repairs the whole
record at once, emits exactly the seven canonical keys `id, title, origin, priority, status,
targetSprint, note`, and names the legacy keys it retires. The current release, **4.48.2**, carries
that operation unchanged.

Nothing is migrated for you. Installing a newer Kyro never rewrites an existing scope, and Doctor
never repairs one on your behalf. The supported path is
`doctor → canonicalize-prepare → explicit values → canonicalize-preview → apply --yes → doctor →
recertify`, where preparation and preview write nothing and Kyro refuses to guess `priority` or
`targetSprint` for you — a suggestion is never an authorization.

[Kyro Lens](https://github.com/synapsync/kyro-lens) verifies the result **read-only**: it recomputes
the commitments and the replay itself rather than trusting Kyro's label, and never repairs anything.

Full workflow, expected failure boundaries and the certification evidence table:
[CLI](docs/cli.md) and [Release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md).

### How routing works

```text
read project state (project.json + local.json) + scopes/{scope}/sprint.json (prefer context-pack)
  → route on handoff.nextAction
    (init → clarify → plan_sprint → execute_task → review_task → close_sprint → done | recover)
  → load only that mode/helper
  → one tool-owned write
```

Unknowns become `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers; `doctor` / `analyze` fail until they are resolved.

---

## What lives where

**Global runtime** (machine-local, replaced on install/sync):

```text
~/.agents/kyro/current/     # commands, skills core, dist/cli.js, manifest.json
~/.agents/skills/kyro-*/    # command skill stubs (standard)
```

**Project** (layered state — team-safe by default):

```text
.agents/kyro/
├── project.json              # SHARED — commit: principles, global conventions, team policy, scopes cache
├── local.json                # LOCAL — gitignored: activeScope, installedAdapters
├── .gitignore                # written by install/sync (local.json, locks)
└── scopes/{scope}/           # SHARED — commit sprint artifacts
    ├── sprint.json           # single source of truth for the scope
    ├── archive/              # write-only at close
    └── findings/             # write-only INIT evidence
```

| Path | Commit? | Holds |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `project.json` | **Yes** | Team constitution (`principles`), global `conventions`, optional `team.minPackageVersion`, scopes registry cache |
| `local.json` | **No** (gitignored) | Personal `activeScope`, machine `installedAdapters` |
| `scopes/**` | **Yes** | Sprint work shared by the team |

CLI invocation is **global** (`~/.agents/kyro/current/manifest.json`), never stored on project files.

Also includes (power users): behavioral evals, MCP (`kyro mcp serve`), append-only trace, portable guardrails — see docs map below. Full multi-dev contract: [Teams](docs/teams.md).

## Upgrade, teams, multi-dev

```bash
# From the project root — refresh runtime + projected skills after a Kyro release
cd /path/to/your-app
npx kyro-ai@latest sync --scope workspace --yes
```

| Pattern | Guidance |
| ------- | -------- |
| **Working directory** | Always install/sync from the **project root**. Global runtime is shared; `.agents/kyro/` is per-cwd. |
| **Upgrade** | Always `npx kyro-ai@latest sync` (or re-`install`) from that root so you get the newest package and refresh the global runtime / projected modes. `kyroInvocation` lives in `~/.agents/kyro/current/manifest.json` (one refresh serves all projects). |
| **Team commit matrix** | Commit `project.json` + `scopes/**`. Do **not** commit `local.json` (personal `activeScope`). Install writes `.agents/kyro/.gitignore` for local-only files — you no longer need to gitignore the entire `.agents/kyro/` tree. |
| **Clone bootstrap** | From the clone root: `install --init-workspace --yes` writes layers if missing, **rehydrates** on-disk scopes into the shared registry, and leaves `activeScope` unset when multiple scopes exist. Then: `… scope set-active <scope> --yes`. |
| **Read-only commands** | `status` / `doctor` / `context-pack` never create project state files; they surface an install bootstrap remedy when layers are missing. |
| **Global bin (optional)** | `npm i -g kyro-ai@latest` for a durable `kyro` on PATH; still prefer `@latest` on every upgrade. |

## FAQ

**Do agents need to install separately, or does the plugin work for everyone?**

The plugin is global (installed once per machine). If you're solo, you're done after `/plugin install kyro-ai`. If your team shares a repo, also run `npx kyro-ai@latest install --init-workspace --yes` from the project root once — it writes `.agents/kyro/project.json` (committed) and `local.json` per dev (gitignored).

**How do I upgrade to the latest version?**

From the project root:

```bash
npx kyro-ai@latest sync --scope workspace --yes
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
npm i -g kyro-ai@latest
kyro sync --scope workspace --yes
```

**Can agents hand-edit `sprint.json`?**

No. Kyro enforces schema and gates through CLI verbs, not prompt discipline. Use `kyro plan --from <file>`, `kyro clarify --from <file>`, `kyro record-evidence`, `kyro review`, and `kyro close-sprint` instead of hand-edits.

**My team has scopes already. How do I join?**

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
npx kyro-ai@latest install --init-workspace --yes
```

Kyro registers existing scopes into `project.json` and creates your personal `local.json`. Then set your active scope:

```bash
kyro scope set-active <scope> --yes
```

**What if `.kyro` ends up in the wrong directory?**

Remove it and reinstall from the correct project root:

```bash
rm -rf ./.agents/kyro
cd /path/to/actual/project
npx kyro-ai@latest install --init-workspace --yes
```

**What's the difference between `/plugin install kyro-ai` and `npx kyro-ai@latest install`?**

- `/plugin install kyro-ai` — installs the Claude Code plugin (global, one-time)
- `npx kyro-ai@latest install` — initializes shared project state (`.agents/kyro/`). Only needed if your team shares the repo. Solo devs don't need to run this.

## Development (contributors)

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run check   # typecheck, versions, links, dist freshness, evals, …
npm pack --dry-run
```

`dist/` must stay in sync with `src/` (`npm run check:dist`). Releases: [release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md).

## Philosophy

1. **Commands over prose** — invoke a workflow; don’t re-paste a 2k-line prompt.
2. **One source of truth per scope** — `sprint.json`, not chat memory.
3. **CLI owns deterministic writes** — health can’t depend on prompt discipline.
4. **One sprint at a time** — adapt from evidence, retro, and debt.
