# Orchestrator — Lean Runtime Contract (v4)

Kyro preserves quality by loading the smallest contract needed for the current lifecycle boundary. The single source of truth is `sprint.json`. Do not load protocols, helpers, templates, or archive Markdown until the routed mode requires them.

## Startup

1. **Resolve `{{KYRO_CLI}}`, once per session.** It is normally substituted by `npx kyro-ai install`/`sync`. If a channel never ran that substitution, resolve the literal token yourself:
   - Run `kyro --version`. If it exits 0, `{{KYRO_CLI}}` means bare `kyro` for the rest of this session.
   - Else, check whether `~/.agents/kyro/current/dist/cli.js` exists. If it does, `{{KYRO_CLI}}` means `node ~/.agents/kyro/current/dist/cli.js`.
   - Else, Kyro's runtime is not installed on this machine. STOP — tell the user to run `npx kyro-ai@latest install --scope workspace --init-workspace --yes` once, then retry. This is not a license to hand-edit `sprint.json` or improvise; same rule as a missing verb in Step 4.
   Use that value for every `{{KYRO_CLI}}` token this session; never run the literal token.
2. Read `project.json` + `local.json`; unreadable stops here.
3. Resolve scope from user input, `local.json.activeScope`, or the only directory under `.agents/kyro/scopes/`; ambiguous or none, ask first.
4. Silently run `{{KYRO_CLI}} repair integrity prepare --kyro-scope <scope> --json` before `context-pack` (isolates unrelated drift; never omit `--kyro-scope`). Findings/blockers → load `assets/modes/recover.md` and stop. None → continue.
5. Capability handshake: run `{{KYRO_CLI}} capabilities --json`. Unknown command, handshake failure, or a missing tool-owned verb means the runtime is unusable: ABORT without mutating Kyro state. Report the observed output of `{{KYRO_CLI}} --version` (or `not installed`) and the exact remedy `npx kyro-ai@latest sync --scope workspace --yes`. Never work around it by hand.
6. Resolve routing with `{{KYRO_CLI}} context-pack --kyro-scope <scope> --json` (lean pack: `nextAction`, `nextTaskId`, `reviewPending`, conventions, budget). Do not open full `sprint.json` to route. No `sprint.json` → INIT.
7. Load `skills/sprint-forge/SKILL.md`, then the single mode named by the pack's `nextAction`.

Open the full `sprint.json` only when `plan_sprint`/`close_sprint`/status-full needs its planning or reporting context (see SKILL.md Read Path Contract). Agents never open it in order to write it.

## Routed Loading (route on `handoff.nextAction`)

| nextAction | Load only |
|-----------|-----------|
| `init` / no `sprint.json` | `assets/modes/INIT.md` + one `helpers/analysis/{workType}.md` |
| `clarify` | `assets/modes/SPRINT.md` + `assets/modes/clarify.md` |
| `plan_sprint` | `assets/modes/SPRINT.md` + `assets/modes/plan-sprint.md` |
| `await_scope_completion` | Ask: complete the finished scope, or explicitly expand it. Complete → `scope complete`; expand → then route as `plan_sprint`. |
| `execute_task` | `assets/modes/SPRINT.md` + `assets/modes/execute-task.md` |
| `review_task` | `assets/modes/SPRINT.md` + `assets/modes/review-task.md` |
| `close_sprint` | `assets/modes/SPRINT.md` + `assets/modes/close-sprint.md` |
| `done` | Stop — already complete or retired. No work mode. |
| inconsistent state | `assets/modes/SPRINT.md` + `assets/modes/recover.md` |
| status report | `assets/modes/STATUS.md` |

Helper boundaries are strict: `sprint-generator` only planning; `debt-tracker` only debt mutation or close; `learner` only at close or on an explicit correction; `reviewer` only validation.

## Write Policy

Every Kyro state mutation is performed by the corresponding CLI verb. Per action:

| Moment | Write only |
|--------|------------|
| Plan sprint | Run `{{KYRO_CLI}} plan --from <file> --kyro-scope <scope>`. |
| Task done | Run `{{KYRO_CLI}} record-evidence ...`. |
| Task reviewed | Run `{{KYRO_CLI}} review ...`. |
| Rule learned | Ask global; use `{{KYRO_CLI}} rule add`; no rule Markdown. |
| Sprint close | Register rules, then run `{{KYRO_CLI}} close-sprint`. It checkpoints, appends `ledger[]`, clears `activeSprint`, and routes to `plan_sprint` only while roadmap work remains; otherwise it awaits the completion/expansion decision. |
| Scope complete | When the user asks to complete/close a finished scope, preview `{{KYRO_CLI}} scope complete`, confirm, then `--yes`. Forge never retires. |

Never edit `sprint.json`, `project.json`, `local.json`, checkpoints, or `archive/` with an editor, patch, or ad-hoc script. Kyro-managed state and history go through the CLI; INIT findings remain write-only analysis evidence.

## Gates and Quality

- Ask for approval only at lifecycle gates (sprint close, scope completion), not after every internal checkpoint.
- Run validation appropriate to touched files before task completion.
- Block completion on failing tests/typecheck, debug artifacts, secrets, syntax errors, or broken imports.
- On failure, reproduce, identify root cause, fix once, revalidate; after three failed correction rounds, mark the task blocked with evidence.

## Lazy Protocols

Load these only when the routed mode needs details:

| Need | Protocol |
|------|----------|
| INIT analysis | `assets/protocols/analysis.md` |
| validation tiers | `assets/protocols/validation.md` |
| failure recovery | `assets/protocols/debug.md` |
| gate copy | `assets/protocols/gates.md` |
| delegated execute/review (opt-in) | `assets/helpers/delegated-execution.md` + `assets/delegates/{implementer,checker}.md` |

## Non-negotiables

- One sprint active at a time.
- `sprint.json` is the live source of truth; immutable checkpoints, legacy snapshots, and Markdown under `archive/` are write-only history.
- Debt never disappears; only its status changes.
- Preserve user work over making state look clean.
- Do not delete standalone skills or registries unless explicitly requested.
